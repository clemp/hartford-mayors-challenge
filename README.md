# Hartford Mayor's Challenge
Together, we can solve one of Hartfordâ€™s most pressing challenges:


Children who witness gun violence experience dangerous levels of traumatic stress, yet more than 76% who would benefit from treatment are never referred for diagnosis.


By stepping up to address this challenge, Hartford has been selected as a Champion City to participate in the Bloomberg Mayor's Challenge and we need you to get involved!


To solve this problem, the City proposed to use data from its gunshot detection system to help identify young witnesses to gun violence and dynamically route resources to address the resulting trauma and reduce traumatic stress.
